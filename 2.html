  <h2>CSS</h2>

    <p style="margin-top:20px">[1] Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applicatons.</p>
    <p>[2] CSS is designed to enable the seperation of content and presentation, including layout, colors and fonts. This seperation can improve content accessibiliy; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a seperats .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.</p>
